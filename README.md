# comparison-between-Singular-Value-Decomposition-SVD-and-Non-negative-Matrix-Factorization-NMF-
The purpose of this assignment is to compare matrix factorization techniques through a facial recognition study.
For this purpose, the CBCL database, originally used in [3]. Note that
the dataset is divided into train and test datasets. In order to perform your first task, you will use the train dataset. The
techniques from [1] will be used in order to carry out the comparison.
